# Ananlysis performed in the SparsePro paper

This repo contains scripts for:

1. [Locus simulation](sim/loc)
2. [Genome-wide simulation](sim/gw)
3. [Fine-mapping of five biomarkers](dat/) 
3. [Visualization](plt/)

For example data and usage of locus fine-mapping with SparsePro, please refer to [SparsePro](https://github.com/zhwm/SparsePro).
For example data and usage of genome-wide fine-mapping with SparsePro, please refer to [SparsePro_gw](https://github.com/zhwm/SparsePro_gw).
For more information, please refer to our [preprint](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.10.04.463133).
